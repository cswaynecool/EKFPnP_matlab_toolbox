# EKFPNP

We compute camera pose parameters from a sequence of images using a sequential estimation procedure.
Taking into account both the camera motion model and the noisy observation model, the results
tend to be more accurate and more robust compared to when the observations are considered alone.
To combine the camera pose history and the uncertainty of image point measurements, the Extended
Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed.

## PnP Toolbox

This toolbox is an extension of the toolbox provided by the authors of
MLPnP, CEPPnP and OPnP
We extended it to show the use of EKFPnP.

## Scripts to produce the synthetic results:
main_ordinary_3d.m        
main_planar.m          
main_ordinary_3d_sigma.m   
main_planar_sigma.m        
main_ordinary_3d_time.m    
main_planar_time.m	   

## Scripts to produce the real results:
main_box.m        
main_sfm.m
